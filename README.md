# Monoids in Scala - My first (wrong) Approach

In this small project I tried to implement categories and
started with Monoids. I did this before really having understood
Scala type classes and the approach of Cats (or Scalaz).
So I used inheritance instead of type classes to write some Monoid
implementations. I stopped when I noticed that the code got too
tangled and complicated.

After that I stopped this approach and digged into the Cats library.
